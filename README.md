Notes
----
- This is a port from the static OpenMoji page to the static site builder [Astro](https://github.com/snowpackjs/astro)
- It's still heavy work-in-progress! A lot (including the OpenMoji library) isn't working yet.
- Astro doesn't automatically resolve relative file paths yet. However, for convenient editting with a Markdown-editor all pages (e.g. `src/pages/samples/index.md`) have the necessary assets in a subfolder. These are copied to `public/` using gulp
